abstract. we present dino detr with improved denoising anchor 
boxes 
state-of- the- art end- -to-end object detector dino improves 
over previous detr like models in performance and efficiency by using 
mixed query selection method 
contrastive way for denoising training, 
for anchor initialization. and 
look forward twice scheme for box pre- 
diction. dino achieves 48 3ap in 12 epochs and 51.0ap in 36 epochs 
resnet 50 backbone and multi- -scale features yield- 
on coco with 
significant improvement of +4.9ap and +2.4ap respectively, 
ing 
compared to dn-detr, the previous best detr- like model. dino 
scales well in both model size and data size. without bells and whistles 
swinl backbone, 
after pre- training on the objects365 dataset with 
dino obtains the best results on both coco val2017 63.2ap) and
